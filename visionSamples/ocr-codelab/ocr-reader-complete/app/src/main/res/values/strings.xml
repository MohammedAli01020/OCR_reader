    <string name="about_us"> Your app should make it easy for users to find their way back to the app\'s main screen. One simple way to do this is to provide an Up button on the app bar for all activities except the main one. When the user selects the Up button, the app navigates to the parent activity.This lesson shows you how to add an Up button to an activity by declaring the activity\'s parent in the manifest, and enabling the app bar\'s Up button.</string>
